# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yann  
## ðŸ›  About Me  
I'm a passionate Minecraft developer specializing in plugins and mods. I run a Minecraft server, Sky X Network, featuring custom game modes like Mining Tycoon and Modded Survival. I love coding in Java (with Maven) and creating Fabric mods to enhance the gameplay experience.  

## ðŸ’» My Projects  
**SkyXNetwork**  
â€“ A fully custom Minecraft server project, featuring unique gameplay mechanics, custom plugins, and a seamless experience for players. 

**SkyXComms/SkyTalk (Work in Progress)**  
â€“ A next-generation communication platform built *for gamers by gamers*, inspired by Discord but with more features, better performance, and a gamer-first UX. This is one of the final goals of the SkyXNetwork project. 

**SkyXControl**  
â€“ A powerful plugin for Minecraft (1.7 - 1.21+) that allows server owners to create custom actions through a simple GUI. It includes zone protection, ranks management, conditional events, and much more!  

**PremiumAdvancements**  
â€“ A plugin that lets you create unlimited Minecraft advancements with full customization, including commands support and an easy-to-use GUI.
