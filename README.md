# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yann  
## ðŸ›  About Me  
I'm a passionate Minecraft developer specializing in plugins and mods. I run a Minecraft server, Sky X Network, featuring custom game modes like Mining Tycoon and Modded Survival. I love coding in Java (with Maven) and creating Fabric mods to enhance the gameplay experience.  

## ðŸ’» My Projects
SkyXControl â€“ A powerful plugin for Minecraft (1.7 - 1.21+) that allows server owners to create custom actions through a simple GUI. It includes zone protection, ranks management, conditional events, and much more!  

HypixelZombieHelper â€“ A Fabric mod improving the Hypixel Zombies mode with a customizable scoreboard and UI enhancements.  

Mining Tycoon â€“ A custom game mode for Sky X Network, featuring resource generators, EXP & Coins economy, and a level-up system.
